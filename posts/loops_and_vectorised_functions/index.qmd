Main points to hit

 - key: this is the natural follow up from writing your own function AND from creating for loops
 - the comparison between for loops and vectorised functions, why should you try to move over to vectorised functions
    - improved run time (usually)
    - human time (more important) - although sometimes I doubt readability
 - how did I learn to understand vectorised functions
 - what is a compelling reason to try/learn
