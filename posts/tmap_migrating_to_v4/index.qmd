Main points to hit

 - demonstrate I can do mapping
 - show some things i used to do
 - show how i have updated those things
 
 
 Here is an example of what i used to do:
 
```{r}
 
 #build on these two layers with customization
map <- tm_shape(seagrass, is.master = T) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0) +
  tm_shape(qld) +
  tm_polygons(col = "grey80") +
  tm_shape(dt_background) +
  tm_polygons(col = "grey90", border.col = "black") +
  tm_shape(dt_marine) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Geographic Area: All", border.col = "black", alpha = 0.3, palette = "Pastel1", legend.show = T) +
  water_map +
  tm_shape(tsv) +
  tm_symbols(size = 0.3, col = "white", border.col = "black", border.lwd = 1, shape = 23) +
  tm_text("PlaceName", shadow = T, auto.placement = T, size = 0.6) +
  tm_shape(seagrass) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Meadow ID", palette = "Set3", border.col = "black", legend.show = F) +
  tm_text("Meadow ID", shadow = T, auto.placement = T, size = 1.5) +
  tm_layout(legend.bg.color = "white", legend.frame = "black", asp = 1.1,
            legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))
 
```

things i have noticed

 - is.master is now is.main. doesn't seem to be a note of that one
 - organisation is much cleaner now, all the fill.xyz can be put together and it is easy to spot which arguments relate to one another
 - text shadow seems to be a legacy aspect
 - setting colours and styles makes much more sense now. doing the cat vs cont, and setting the palette etc.
 - my preferred lay out has changed. I now like to list each argument under the next - helps with grouping but does make code have more lines
