Main points to hit

 - what are functions really
 - why would you want to make one
 - how can you go about making a functions
 - what is a compelling reason - note that often the big ideas are "already taken", usually your first function is something super specific
 
 
 # Introduction
 
If you're anything like me, when you first thought of creating functions it seemed so wildly out of your comfort zone that you decided against it. Well hopefully this post does something to dissuade the fear, and push you to start creating your own custom functions in your every day work. The topic of functions might seem really big and scary at first, but the reality is far from that, and hopefully the short length of this post confirms that. Below, we cover the essentials;

 - What are functions really,
 - Why you should consider making custom functions,
 - How you can make your own functions,
 - and some compelling reasons for functions.

Want to see a function in action? I've already written an entire blog post about a function I use almost every day! Check it out [here](../an_opinionated_dataframe_cleaner/index.qmd), it is all about cleaning and organizing dataframes.
