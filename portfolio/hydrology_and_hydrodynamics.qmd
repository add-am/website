Rain comes in massive peaks and troughs, cyclones tear across the ocean, and winds and currents stir the coast into a swirling mix of salt, sand, and sediment. The <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/40fb1343dd8f4a8f9edc3b51e2346943" class="main-links"> Hydrology and Hydrodynamics of Cleveland Bay</a> story explores, from the very beginnings, the journey of water across Cleveland Bay: where it comes from, where it goes, what it does, and how it does it. It explores the impact of humans on water, what impacts are yet to come, and how we can best prepare for the future.
